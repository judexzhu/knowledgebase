# Extended Testing - Basic Fabric Burn-In Tests for Nodes.

This page gives a brief description of what burn-in tests should be run on nodes that have an Interconnect Card:

* Run single round of HPL across nodes in configuration group (max size 32 nodes) using Interconnect. [[HPL|Burn-In-Tests:-HPL]]
* Run Intel MPI Benchmark (IMB) across each pair of nodes in configuration group - Use script as provided. [[IMB|Burn-In-Tests:-IMB]]
