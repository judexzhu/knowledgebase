# Standard Burn-In Tests for Nodes.

This page gives a brief description of what BASIC burn-in tests should be run on any node to be built:

1. Run Memtester for 1 loop -  [[Memtester|Burn-In-Tests:-Memtester]]
2. Run iozone across system disk - [[IOZone|Burn-In-Tests:-IOZone]]
3. Run single round of HPL - [[HPL|Burn-In-Tests:-HPL]]
